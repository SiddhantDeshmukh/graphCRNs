# TODO list

## Week of 27/09/21

### Solver

- Check if Jacobian function can be compiled to improve runtime

### Network

- Finalise solar CO network

* Finalise metal-poor CNO network

- Run CO5BOLD models

### Pathfinding

- Run pathfinding for _final_ solar CO network in characteristic
  regions of the solar photosphere (pick a few)
- Reaction string -> Reaction lookup (or keep a reference to Reaction
  when creating graph)

### Writeup

- Graph CRN theory
- Graph theoretical kinetics
- Examples using ring reaction network and an astrophysical case
  - Perhaps a simplified CO network to illustrate the idea of complexes?
    - Could be hydrogen ionisation as well, plus H2
