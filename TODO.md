# TODO list

## Week of 27/09/21

### Network

- Add method to init from chem.dat
- Create 'simplify' test
- Simplify CO network across CO5BOLD model

### Simplification

- Implement path flux analysis (PFA)
- Test on dummy networks
- Test on CO
- Use on CNO

### Writeup

- Graph CRN theory
- Graph theoretical kinetics
- Examples using ring reaction network and an astrophysical case
  - Perhaps a simplified CO network to illustrate the idea of complexes?
    - Could be hydrogen ionisation as well, plus H2
